        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Anurag Chandra, and I come from the village in the Rohtas district near Sasaram, a region that is
            quite backward in
            terms of educational resources and opportunities. Despite the challenges posed by my surroundings, I was
            determined to clear the JEE Mains exam and pursue my dream of becoming an engineer. This is the story of my
            journey, from my humble beginnings in Roh to achieving success in one of the most competitive exams in
            India.
        <h3>Preparation journey</h3>
        <p>I started actual preparation after passing 11th.I first subscribed to some online coaching (academy)
        which was useless and it ruined my 11th.Then i got to know about PW I started preparing from their.
        But the motivaton for restart came from a teacher i met in 11th."Anirudhh sinha" he is the one person who
        made me beleive that JEE is doable from home.</p>

        <h3>Exam Experience</h3><hr>
        <h5>jee session 1 exam date- 25 january 2024<br>
            jee session 2 exam date- 6 april 2023<br>
            board exam date- 1st February to 7th February 2024
        </h5><hr>
        <p>In the weeks leading up to my JEE Mains exam on January 25th, I had almost given up. My focus shifted entirely
        towards my board exams, which were starting on February 1st. Given the requirement of securing at least 75% in
        the boards, I prioritized them over JEE Mains, dedicating my time and energy to ensure I met this critical
        benchmark.
        <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        For three months, I halted my JEE preparation to concentrate solely on my board studies. Despite this shift in
        focus, when I sat for the JEE Mains exam, I approached it with a calm mindset, without the intense pressure I
        had initially felt. To my surprise and delight, I managed to score an 89 percentile.
        <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        Achieving this score, even after pausing my JEE preparation for such a significant period, was a pivotal moment
        for me. It instilled a newfound confidence that, with dedicated effort and a structured plan, I could indeed
        crack the JEE. This unexpected success reaffirmed my belief in my abilities and motivated me to continue
        pursuing my dream with renewed vigor.
        <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        I resumed my preparation with renewed determination, focusing intensely on the next attempt. On April 6th, I
        appeared for the second attempt of JEE Mains. This time, my efforts paid off even more significantly—I scored a
        95.5 percentile, qualifying for the JEE Advanced.
        <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

        Despite this achievement and the opportunity to secure a seat in an NIT, I made a strategic decision. I chose
        not to fill the JEE Advanced form and instead decided to take an early drop year to prepare more thoroughly. I
        believed that with an additional year of focused preparation, I could achieve even better results and secure a
        spot in one of the top IITs. This decision marked a new chapter in my journey, one driven by confidence,
        strategic planning, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.
        <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

        After taking the drop, I started preparing again with the help of Physics Wallah (PW). This renewed preparation
        was rigorous and well-structured. On February 1st, 2024, I sat for the JEE Mains exam once again and achieved a
        remarkable 98.16 percentile. This accomplishment was a testament to my hard work, perseverance, and the
        effectiveness of my preparation strategy.</p>
